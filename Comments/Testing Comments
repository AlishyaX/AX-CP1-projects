# Alishya Xavier, Comment Challenge

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the comment challenge 
# Here I made a code that runs a question, which is then answered by the user.
# Then it prints hello and then the name inputed.
# Date: 10/1/24
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

name = input("What is your name?")# This line of code asks the user what their name is and savces it into the variable name.
print("hello", name)# This line of code takes the value in name and prints it with hello in front of it.
